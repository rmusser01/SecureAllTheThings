# Overviews

This project has several different classifications of files, based on the classification there are different reuqirements before contributions will be accepted. Here are the types of documents & some of the requirements.

# Document types & requirements

* Technical walkthrough
  * Requires a 'valid as of $date' note, version information for all dependencies, and required section to covery any 'impacts' which can happen either while implementing the information in the walkthrough or from using it. For instance, installing a log forwarding agent may have direct system impact, running a network or vulnerability scanner may cause network load issues; guidance should be provided where possible on how to minimize or monitor for impacts. Must include the following 'sections'
  * The difference between this document type and 'implementation guide' is that technical walkthroughs are more narrow - setting up a system, assessing a technology for risks, or individual security actions (how to set up private keys for ssh, etc.) Implementation guides are more about the program/function level - setting up a vulnerability management program versus setting up nessus).

* Topic Overview
  * Must include the following 'sections'
  
* Scripts/CLI tools
  * Must be thoroughly documented
  * Top of script must include the following information: `sections`....
  * Must notate any leftover artifacts

* Implementation guide
  * Requires a 'valid as of $date' note, version information for all dependencies, and required section to covery any 'impacts' which can happen either while implementing the information in the walkthrough or from using it.
