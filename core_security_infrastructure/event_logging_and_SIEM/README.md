# Overview

SIEMs (Security Information & Event Management) and Event Logging are tremendously valuable to information security functions. A SIEM typically receives 'events' from a wide variety of systems, normalizes the data in some ways, and is then used to drive alerts, reports, and send other events based on the contents of the events received. Event logging is the configurations for systems or applications to record certain types of activities and what happens with those events - such as forwarding to a centralized system, retaining them for a certain duration, etc.
