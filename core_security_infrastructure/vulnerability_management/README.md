# Overview
Vulnerability management is a process which invoves detecting vulnerabilities, determining risk, remediating vulnerabilities or otherwise mitigating vulnerabilities, and establishing lifecycle processes to minimize the number and risk of issues which arise.

# Getting Starting with Vulnerability Management
The best first step to start developing a vulnerability management program for your organization is to find out what types of vulnerabilites are present. This can be done with several tools, the most prominent open-source tool is OpenVAS and there are many commercial alternatives.

Here are some key steps in building out a funcitoning vulnerability management program
* Identify your networks and assets - knowing where to scan (networks, cloud resources, etc), how to get there (do you need multiple scanners for unroutable networks? can you scan everything from one place?), and what you're scanning for (are you trying to patch everything? do you want to start by looking for externally visibile vulnerabilities? are you using the apprpriate scanner to detect what you care about?)
* Properly deploy a vulnerability scanner appropriate for your scope
* Test scans to minimize potential impacts and understand the ramifications of the scanner(s)
* Create a scan schedule and make sure it works! Save everything after you get things going, you'll want to see your progress and know when things change.
* Evaluate the scan results. You're remediation plan, targeted remedian deadlines (x days for criticals, etc) will all depend on where you're starting. If you already have 1000000 criticals, prioitize fixing those before building timelines for new criticals. Even if there are 100000 criticals, not all are equally bad, you'll need to evaluate them and target what matters most first.
* The rest is more nuanced, this guide will help you get to this point and then propose some options after you reach a point of consistent planning and priorizied vulnerabilities.
