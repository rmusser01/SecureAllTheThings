# Overview

Asset Management is a critical process for organizations which is performed to understand what needs to be protected, where it is, who owns it and sometimes more detailed information like what it does. At it's simplest level asset management can be a routinely updated spreadsheet tracking devices on the network; at its most complex it can be a continuous scanning process identifying assets, updating their status, tracking expected lifecycle and depreciation, and more. Asset management often ties in to other programs such as business impact, continuinty and disaster recovery plans. 

# Starting a Process 

Starting this type of program can be done by creating a spreadsheet of critical assets which should remain relatively static - such as network devices, domain controllers, or others - and recording some inforamtion such as OS/firmware version, IP address, and the 'team' or 'person' who owns it. 

Once this is done, depending on the size of your organization, it may be worth creating a 'policy' (see policy templates) around asset management which specifices a cadence, series of collected attributes, and process. It may also be worth moving immediately to a 'next' level of maturity by using an automated discovery tool - like nmap - to scan your networks and provide a listing of all devices.
